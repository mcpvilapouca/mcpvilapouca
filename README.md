### Nice to see you! &nbsp; ![](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=mcpvilapouca.mcpvilapouca&style=flat-square&color=fbbc64)

I'm a Mechanical Engineer from Porto, Portugal. I finished my PhD in March 2022 👩🏽‍🎓 and I'm currrently working as a postoctoral researcher at INEGI. During my PhD, I discovered my passion for programming 👩🏽‍💻 I started to dedicate my free time to improve my skills python 🐍 and learn machine learning techiques 💻🌱 and my aim now is to become a Data Scientist 📈👩🏽‍🔬 ! I really enjoy to learn and be challenged and I'm excited with the future.

As for hobbies, I love to read 📚 and I was an artistic rollerskater for more than 15 years. Now I love to run and I started surfing lessons last summer 🛼 🏄.
